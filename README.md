# github repository for maintaining FAMT's VLSI Lab experiments

This github repository contains the following FPGA based lab experiments
- Sorting algorithm implementation
- Hashing algorithm implementation
- SPI sensor integration to FPGA

The experiments are targeted to be implemented using Intel MAX10 FPGA. 

The projects are organised in the following structure
- project_name
  - src - contains HDL - Verilog/VHDL source code
  - par - Place & Route folder. This folder contains all the Quartus tool generated files. 
  - doc - documents and project requirement files
  - sim - testbench & simulation output files

  
_Lab experiments are created for Finolex Academy of Management & Technology (www.famt.ac.in)_
