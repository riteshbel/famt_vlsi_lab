# Introduction: github repository for managing FAMT's VLSI Lab experiments

This github repository contains the following FPGA based lab experiments
- Hashing algorithm implementation
- Sorting algorithm implementation
- SPI sensor integration to FPGA

The experiments are targeted to be implemented in Intel MAX10 FPGA. We will use Intel's MAX10 FPGA development kit
